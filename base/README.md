Business-Central Workbench Docker image
=============================================

We changed the location for our docker images from Docker to [RedHat Quay](https://quay.io/repository/kiegroup/business-central-workbench)

From the versions > 7.61.0.Final on the images will only be available on Quay.

Introduction
------------

The image contains:  
             
* JBoss Wildfly 23.0.2.Final
* KIE Business-Central Workbench 7.62.0.Final

This image provides the KIE Business-Central Workbench. It's intended to be extended so you can add your custom configurations.

If you don't want to extend this image and you just want to try business-central Workbench take a look at the `quay.io/kiegroup/business-central-workbench:latest` Docker image, it contains some default configurations.

Usage
-----

To run a container:
    
    docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8001:8001 -d --name business-central-workbench quay.io/kiegroup/business-central-workbench:latest

Once container and web applications started, you can navigate into the business-central Workbench at:

    http://localhost:8080/business-central

Users and roles
----------------

The application have no users or roles configured, so you cannot not access it by default,               

In order to use it, at least you have to create an application user in JBoss Wildfly with role `admin`.                  

If you are looking for a KIE Business-Central Workbench image that does not require to add custom configurations, try our `quay.io/kiegroup/business-central-workbench:latest` Docker image.

If you want to create your custom configuration and users, role, etc, you can take a look at section `Extending this image`                  


Logging
-------

You can see all logs generated by the `standalone` binary running:

    docker logs [-f] <container_id>
    
You can attach the container by running:

    docker attach <container_id>

The JBoss Business-Central Workbench web application logs can be found inside the container at path:

    /opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/log/server.log

    Example:
    sudo nsenter -t $(docker inspect --format '{{ .State.Pid }}' $(docker ps -lq)) -m -u -i -n -p -w
    -bash-4.2# tail -f /opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/log/server.log

GIT internal repository
-----------------------

The workbench stores all the project artifacts in an internal GIT repository. By default, the protocol available for accessing the GIT repository is `SSH` at port `8001`.            

You can clone the GIT repository by running:           

    git clone ssh://admin@localhost:8001/system

By default, the GIT repository is created when the application starts for first time at `$WORKING_DIR/.niogit`, considering `$WORKING_DIR` as the current directory where the application server is started.            

You can specify a custom repository location by setting the following Java system property to your target file system directory:                   
 
        -Dorg.uberfire.nio.git.dir=/home/youruser/some/path

NOTE: This directory can be shared with your docker host and with another containers using shared volumes when running the container, if you need so.            

If necessary you can make GIT repositories available from outside localhost using the following Java system property:                 
 
        -org.uberfire.nio.git.ssh.host=0.0.0.0
        
You can set this Java system properties permanent by adding the following lines in your `standalone-full.xml` file as:                
 
        <system-properties>
          <!-- Custom repository location. -->
          <property name="org.uberfire.nio.git.dir" value="/home/youruser/some/path"/>
          <!-- Make GIT repositories available from outside localhost. -->
          <property name="org.uberfire.nio.git.ssh.host" value="0.0.0.0"/>
        </system-properties>
    
NOTE: Users and password for ssh access are the same that for the web application users defined at the realm files.   

Extending this image
--------------------

You can extend this image and add your custom layers in order to add custom configurations, users, roles, etc.                  
 
In order to extend this image, your Dockerfile must inherit from:

    FROM quay.io/kiegroup/business-central-workbench:latest
    
**Configuring Wildfly**

* The Wildfly configuration files are located at `/opt/jboss/wildfly/standalone/configuration`                   
* In this file you can modify all Wildfly's subsystem configurations                           
* Custom modifications should be done in `standalone.xml` configuration file

**Users and roles**

* By default this image does not provide users and roles for JBoss Business-Central Workbench

* The available roles for KIE Business-Central Workbench examples are:

        ROLE        DESCRIPTION
        *************************************************
        admin       The administrator
        analyst     The analyst
        kiemgmt     KIE management user
        rest-all    Rest API permissions
        Accounting  Accounting role
        PM          Project manager role
        HR          Human resources role
        sales       Sales role
        IT          IT role

These are the steps to create custom users and roles by using realm files in Widlfly:                  

1.- copy the whole dir https://github.com/kiegroup/business-central/tree/7.62.0.Final/showcase/etc/kie-fs-realm-users to<br>
$JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/

kie-fs-realm-users should be owned by user jboss (chown jboss:jboss -R $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/configuration/kie-fs-realm-users)

2.- copy the file https://github.com/mbiarnes/business-central/blob/7.62.0.Final/showcase/etc/jbpm-custom.cli to<br>
$JBOSS_HOME/bin/

With this you have created the users

        user        roles
        ******************************************************
        admin       admin, analyst, kiemgmt, rest-all
        jack        analyst, HR
        john        analys, Accounting, PM
        katy        analyst, IT
        krisv       admin, analyst
        sales-rep   analyst, sales
        

3.- The `standalone.xml` file will be changed by `jbpm-custom.cli`               
        
You can find an example by looking at the Dockerfile for `quay.io/kiegroup/business-central-workbench:latest` image.

Experimenting
-------------

To spin up a shell in one of the containers try:

    docker run -t -i -p 8080:8080 -p 8001:8001 quay.io/kiegroup/business-central-workbench:latest /bin/bash

You can then noodle around the container and run stuff & look at files etc.


Troubleshoot
------------

If the application can't be accessed via browser (http://localhost:8080/business-central) please run the container in [host network mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#network-settings). It seems that latest docker versions have some restrictions on the networking side. Using an older daemon version this does not happen. 
Try:
    
    docker run .... --network="host .."
